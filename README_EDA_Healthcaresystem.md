# 🩺 Exploratory Data Analysis on Healthcare System  
_A Data Exploration Project by Samratha Reddy_

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a healthcare dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about patient demographics, medical conditions, admission trends, and relationships among key variables such as age, diagnosis, billing amount, and test outcomes.

**GitHub Repository:** [EDA on Healthcare System](https://github.com/samrathareddy/EDA-on-Healthcare-system)

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset/data)
- **Size:** ~1.1 MB  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Key Features:**
  - `Age`, `Gender`, `Blood Type`
  - `Medical Condition`, `Doctor`, `Test Results`
  - `Date of Admission`, `Discharge Date`, `Admission Type`
  - `Billing Amount`

---

## 🧪 Analysis Performed

### ✅ Data Preparation
- Imported libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Handled missing values, incorrect formats, and outliers
- Converted date columns and derived `admission_duration`

### 📈 Key Analyses
- Summary statistics and distributions
- Patient demographics (age, gender, blood type)
- Medical condition breakdown by age
- Admission duration trends
- Billing amount analysis by diagnosis and admission type
- Correlation heatmaps and multi-variable visualizations

---

## ❓ Questions Explored

- What is the age and gender distribution of patients?
- How do medical conditions vary by age group?
- Do billing amounts correlate with admission types or diagnoses?
- Is there a relationship between test results and medical conditions?
- How long do patients with different diagnoses stay admitted?

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualizations
